This project is a personal website built with React and Vite. Its main purpose is not to be a professional portfolio, but rather a personal space where I can experiment, learn, and practice my web development skills. From the beginning, the idea was to create a simple site where I could introduce myself, share some of my interests, and organize in a clear way some of the projects I have been working on.
